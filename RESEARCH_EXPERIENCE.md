# Research: Web3 Experiences & Reward Systems

**Objective**: Define how AETERNA can "plug in" to the broader ecosystem and generate tangible value (Prizes) for users.

## 1. Case Studies: What Works?

### A. POAP (The Memory Layer)

- **Mechanism**: "I was there." Simple, non-transferable NFTs.
- **Why it works**: Social Signaling. People love collecting badges.
- **AETERNA Opportunity**: Every "Pulse Tap" at a specific stage (e.g., Main Stage) could mint a "Micro-POAP" (Compressed NFT) as a memory fragment.

### B. Galxe / QuestN (The Bounty Hunter)

- **Mechanism**: "Do X, Get Y." (Follow Twitter, Join Discord, Hold NFT -> Get Whitelist).
- **Why it works**: Clear ROI. Users know exactly what they get.
- **AETERNA Opportunity**: "The Festival Quest."
  - *Quest*: "Visit all 3 stages and buy 1 water."
  - *Reward*: Automatic entry into a raffle for a VIP Upgrade.

### C. StepN / Genopets (Move-to-Earn)

- **Mechanism**: Physical activity = Digital Asset growth.
- **AETERNA Opportunity**: "Dance-to-Evolve."
  - Use phone accelerometer data (locally verified) to track "Energy."
  - High Energy = Faster Stone Evolution.

## 2. "Plugging In" (Interoperability)

How does AETERNA connect to others?

### A. The "Guest List" (Inbound)

- **Concept**: If you hold a *Bored Ape* or *Mad Lad*, your AETERNA Stone starts at "Stage 1" (Gold).
- **Tech**: On-Chain verification of user's other assets during Mint.
- **Benefit**: Instant partnership value. "Hey Mad Lads, come to our festival for VIP treatment."

### B. The "Loot Box" (Outbound)

- **Concept**: The AETERNA Stone is a "Container" (Metaplex Core can hold other assets?).
- **Tech**: Sponsors airdrop tokens/NFTs *into* the Stone.
- **Scenario**:
  - Red Bull sponsors the event.
  - Every Stone that reaches "Active State" automatically receives a "Red Bull Digital Can" NFT.
  - Burn the "Digital Can" at the bar for a real Red Bull.

## 3. Prize Mechanics (The Loot)

### A. Dynamic Raffles

- **Logic**: Every $10 spent via Pulse = 1 Raffle Ticket (On-Chain).
- **Prize**: 1 BTC, Backstage Passes, Lifetime Tickets.
- **Tech**: Chainlink VRF (Randomness) picks the winner at midnight.

### B. "Golden Ticket" Drops

- **Logic**: 1 in 1000 Stones contains a hidden "Winner" trait upon Resurrection.
- **Prize**: Instant upgrade to Artist Access.

## 4. Proposed Strategy: "The Open Quest Protocol"

Don't just build a wallet. Build a **Quest Engine**.

1. **Event Organizer** defines Quests: "Buy Merch", "Arrive Early", "Recycle Cups".
2. **User** completes Quests via Pulse (Spending) or App (Scanning).
3. **Reward**: Not just XP, but **Solana Tokens** (USDC/BONK) or **Real Prizes** (Merch).

**Conclusion**: To make AETERNA addictive, it must pay the user back—either in Status (Evolution), Access (VIP), or Value (Prizes).
